        <div class="flexItem item2"> <p class= textboxBorder>Atreus was first introduced in 2018â€™s God of War. He is the son of Kratos and Faye, and he accompanies his father in fulfilling his mothers final request: to spread her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms. As a child, he is very rash and inexperienced. Kratos teaches him to be disciplined in combat and to control his anger. Later in the game, Atreus falls to a crippling illness as a result of Kratos telling him that the gods are cruel while unaware that both he and his father are both themselves gods. This inner conflict of being born with the powers of a god and not knowing how to control them took a toll on him, only to be cured when Kratos shared with him the truth. In the game, Atreus accompanies the player in their adventures and the player can tell Atreus to shoot enemies with his bow.</p></div>
