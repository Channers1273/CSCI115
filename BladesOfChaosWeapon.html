            <p class="textboxBorder">The Blades of Chaos, forged by Ares himself, were the weapons Kratos was given when he first started working for Ares. They have become the iconic weapon for this character and are associated with most of his acts of violence throughout the games. Naturally, Kratos first refused to use them during his adventures with Atreu, but when deperate times came to desperate measures, he would pick them up once more to save his son. The blades are packed with primordial fire, and a wide range of flaming attacks can be achieved with these twin blades. They feature chains on the pommels, allowing Kratos to grapple to enemies, or pull them closer. </p>
