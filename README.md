# CSCI115

This is a miniature wiki (if you will) about my favourite game series "God of War". I made this for my CSCI 115 course at VIU. The aim of this website is to inform the reader about the main gist of the series while practicing my web dev skills. While some elements did fall short of my original vision, I am still proud of the result. For example, I wish I knew how to add a dropdown menu when hovering over a button in the navigation bar, but I don't, so I settled for having a page that contains links to others as something of a "buffer" if you will between the page you were on and the one you wanted to get to. Also, I wanted to incorporate JavaScript, but didn't see a whole lot of oppertunity, so I settled for a simple alert welcoming you to the page. Overall, I am quite happy with the end result. My favourite feature is the logo leading back to the home page.
