            <p class="textboxBorder">Kratos is the main protagonist in the series. In the first game, as he leds his army into battle, they encountered an army of barbarians who overpowered them. Moments from death, Kratos cried out to the Greek god of war, Ares, pledging that if he destroys the barbarians, he will give his life to him in return. Ares took the opportunity and made quick work of making Kratos his servant. He was then sent to attack a village, not realizing it housed his wife and child until their blood stained his blades. Kratos then swore revenge on the god, killing him and taking the throne as the new god of war. The following games focus on Kratos and his relationship with his father, Zeus. After being tricked into giving up his godly powers and being sent to the underworld by Zeus himself, he swears revenge on yet another god of Olympus, and the outcome is more or less the same as that of his conflict with Ares. In the newest two games, Kratos is trying to redeem himself from his past actions of cruelty and violence. He settles down with a new woman named Faye and raises his son, Atreus to be strong and courageous whilst trying to keep his identity as a god a secret from his son. </p>
